# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- CFriffer (https://cfripper.readthedocs.io/en/0.19.0/)

### Example vulnerability

EBSVolumeHasSSERule
- Checks that server side encryption is enabled for all EBS volumes.
- Data that is not encrypted at rest could breach regulatory compliance and allow easier access for an attacker to view any instace storage data of your EC2 instance.

EC2SecurityGroupOpenToWorldRule
- Checks if security groups have an ingress IP that is open to the world for ports other than 80 and 443. All other ports should be closed off from public access to prevent a serious security misconfiguration.
- Most security groups only need to be accessed privately, and this can typically be done by specifying the CIDR of a Security Group's ingress to 10.0.0.0/8 or similar.

KMSKeyCrossAccountTrustRule
- Checks for KMS keys that allow cross-account principals to get access to the key.
- It might allow other AWS identities to read/modify the secrets.


## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

- Anchore (https://docs.anchore.com/current/)

### Example vulnerability

- security vulnerabilities
- package whitelists and blacklists
- configuration file contents
- presence of credentials in image
- image manifest changes
- exposed ports


## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- Amazon Inspector
- Amazon Security Hub
- Amazon Config

### Example vulnerability

- On instance i-00cd740478c384310, UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
- SSM.1 EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager
Finding ID: arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:526174966849:subscription/aws-foundational-security-best-practices/v/1.0.0/SSM.1/finding/0aeb1a84-7f47-421f-86a9-4b9c75d57175
- Noncompliant Rules: Checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted. If you specify the ID of a KMS key for encryption using the kmsId parameter, the rule checks if the EBS volumes in an attached state are encrypted with that KMS key.
